# E-commerce: Breaking Waves Website
This website is manually coded without using any framework and it's the second one that I built for my portfolio. In this case, I chose the palette colors to use and designed the website layout before coding, so I had a precise idea on what to do to make the coding job easier for me. It's a front end project, but in the future I could add some back end to it, for example putting together the cart shop.
